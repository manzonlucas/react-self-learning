# react-self-learning

My React self-learning journey from different sources.

All the projects development environments were set up using create-react-app. \
Inside each project folder you will find the corresponding readme with its details.

To get started with any of them, first install all the required packages/dependencies, in the project directory run:
### `npm install`

Then, to get the app running:
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. \
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

# Projects:
